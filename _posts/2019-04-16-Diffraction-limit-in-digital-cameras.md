How big is the Airy disk for a digital camera?

In a digital camera, the user can shrink the diaphragm to let more 
or less light into the sensor. By doing this, interesting things
happen, in one hand, by making the aperture smaller, the wavefront of light
passes through the less curved part of the lenses (the central part) so 
refractive aberrations are less dominant. In practice this translates to the 
image being very forgiving in terms of focus.

Another interesting phenomenon that happens when the user makes the 
aperture small is diffraction. Diffraction is a quite well understood phenomenon. It arises from the fact that light is a wave and when waves interact with 
a limited aperture the well colimated wavefront spills in different angles.

The way light 'spills' depends on the physical shape of the aperture. The 
simplest being a perfectly round aperture (camera diaphragms are not 
round, but with a round one we can actually calculate the diffraction limit
easily). For a round aperture, the distribution of light in the focal plane
generated by diffraction at the aperture is named the Airy disk [1]. Qualitatively
 this Airy disk is described by a disk where the distribution of light is
 concentrated surrounded by rings that decrease in amplitude as they are 
further and further away from the center.

The Airy disk has a size that can be computed by integrating the field 
of a plane wave over a circular screen. This computation can be looked up 
in any optics textbook. For this (introductory level) note, I will limit 
myself to give the prescription. The size of the Airy disk is given by 

angle in radians = 1.22 lambda/D.

Here the angle is given in radians, lambda is the wavelenth of light and D is the physical diameter of the aperture. Lambda and D need to have the same units. Evaluating this expression for visible light of 500nm and an aperture of 
55mm (from my Canon T6), we get 

```
In [5]: np.rad2deg(1.22 * 500e-9/55e-3)*60*60
Out[5]: 2.287664214740523 
```

Or 2 arcseconds of angular resolution.

This is with the diaphragm wide open. If we decrease the size of the diaphragm
 we will get a larger angle which means lower angular resolution.

How small does the diaphragm need to be in order to compete with the size 
of a pixel?. We can give an estimate by writing down the formula for 
the Airy disk but instead of using an angle, we use the focal lenght of the
 the system to translate angles to focal plane position.

Airy disk size [in microns] = 1.22 lambda f/D = 1.22 lambda F/#

Here I use the symbol F/# commonly used by photographers, to denote the F
number of the system or the ratio of the focal length to the diameter.

Now it's time to evaluate this formula. To start seeing the effects of
 diffraction we need the Airy disk to be larger than a pixel (or more). For a Canon T6, the pixel size is 4.3 microns. What is the minimum F/# that will 
give a diffraction limited spot larger than 4 microns? 

```
In [8]: 4.3e-6/(1.22 * 650.e-9)
Out[8]: 5.4224464060529645
```

So the diffraction limited spot size for this camera starts competing with the size of the pixel size at around F/5 (here I used the wavelength of red light which is the wavelength that diffracts first). In practice I expect the effects of diffraction happening at larger F numbers, as one pixel is quite small to make an effect in the overall picture. For the spot size to be the size of
two pixels, then we need a F/10. 

The devil is in the details, things that change in an actual camera are: 
refractive aberrations and the actual shape of the diaphragm. However I think 
this model is accurate enough that it can actually be compared to a picture. Note here that if you are using a crappy lens, then the Airy disk might not show up until the diaphragm is quite small, the reason being that you started with a quite large point spread function that already covers more than one pixel.For the diffraction limit to show up in an image, a good quality lens is a must.
