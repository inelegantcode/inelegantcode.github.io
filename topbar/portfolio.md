Here I list some of the projects I have been involved during my PhD studies.

1. **Silicon metamaterial antireflection coatings for Terahertz optics:**
   Silicon is a common material for milimeter and sub-milimeter (TeraHertz)
cameras. One common problem of silicon is the refractive reflection that
arises at the vaccum-silicon interface. In this work we explore a micron scale
 metamaterial structure that acts as an anti reflection coating. I took part in
the design and construction of Deep Reactive Ion Etched sub wavelength
structures for use at 850GHz. We demonstrated reflections lower than
1% in the band of interest. Results were published in an
[Applied Optics paper][1].
2. **Detector testing and aliasing measurements for Advanced ACTPol:** Aliasing
is a phenomenon that must be addressed in any time domain sampled detection
system. In this project we test Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers for 
use in the Advanced ACTPol instrument in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We 
measure the frequency domain noise of the detectors and select an optimum
anti aliasing filter that does not degrade detector operation. Our experiments
were taken in consideration for the deployment of Advanced ACTPol focal plane
 presented in an [SPIE conference proceeding][2].
3. **Optical design evaluation for the Simons Observatory:** The Simons
Observatory will be a six meter telescope operating in the millimeter band.
Scientific objectives of the Simons Observatory include high sensitivity,
polarization sensitive measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation
power spectrum, galaxy cluster science via the thermal and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects among others. I took part in the optical design team
that designed the optics of the cryogenic cameras. In particular, I worked
evaluating image quality, geometric distortions, F-Numbers and telecentricity
for candidate designs. Our work was summarized in a
[SPIE conference proceeding][3].
4. **Sidelobes and spillover ray tracing calculations for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope:**
Sidelobes are often hard to predict for large (thousands of wavelengths) systems.
A variety of physical mechanisms can cause them and detailed physical models
are required to explain them, which often require measurements of material optical
properties. In this work we build a physical model that explains the sidelobe
structure of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our model requires measurements
 of the optical spillover of the cryogenic camera as it is deployed and a
CAD model that was built from photogrammetry by a collaborator (RP). Results
were presented in the 2018 [SPIE conference][4].
5. **Sidelobes forecasts for the Simons Observatory:**
I am currently using the modeling technique used to explain ACT's sidelobes
to put constraints in the sidelobe pattern for the Simons Observatory. This
work will be presented in my PdD thesis defense.
