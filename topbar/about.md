I am PhD student in the field of Physics, I work on experimental cosmology building and designing experiments that probe the Cosmic Microwave Background, the oldest light in the universe.

I am part of the [Atacama Cosmology Telescope](https://act.princeton.edu), and the [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org) collaborations.
