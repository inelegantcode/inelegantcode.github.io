How much power would you get if the back of your cellphone was covered in solar cells?

A typical smartphone measures 7cm by 14 cm. For a solar irradiance of 1.3kW/m^2, this area collects 12.7 watts. A state of the art solar cell has an efficiency of 20% at most, so these 12.7 Watts become 2.55 Watts that can actually be used.

How much power does a smartphone use?

According to experiments run by wired [1], the minimum an iphone in low power mode reaches 1.3 watts, however typical use (no video playback or gps) is in the 2.3 watt range. This means that the power a solar cell would deliver as of 2018 is getting close to the bare minimum to keep the phone running (without even charging the battery), playing a video or making a phone call would most likely start using up the battery. This means that in order to charge the battery the phone would need to be off.

With the phone off, how much time would it take for the phone to get to full charge?

An iphone 7 has a battery of 11.1Wh according to ifixit [2] which at a 90% charging efficiency would charge in 4.4 hours. This assumes a perfect alinement from the sun to the solar cell, allowing a 30 degree error in the alignment and the charging time goes up to 5 hours, add clouds and the time goes even higher...
